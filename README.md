## Features
 
### 📊 Dashboard
At-a-glance summary of your academic standing. Shows cumulative GWA, WAG, units completed, degree progress, course status breakdown (passed, available, blocked, failed, incomplete), and recommended next courses.
 
### 📝 Grade Manager
Enter and manage grades semester by semester. Supports:
- GWA and WAG computation per semester and cumulatively
- GWA includes all academic courses (excludes PE and NSTP)
- WAG excludes INC grades
- Retake tracking — original and retake attempts stay in separate semesters
- Custom course support
- Elective renaming
- Planner-synced layout toggle
### 🎓 Degree Audit
Full audit of the BS CoE curriculum. Shows the status of every course — passed, available, blocked (unmet prerequisites), failed, or in progress — with prerequisite and corequisite checking.
 
### 🏆 Scholarship Monitor
Automatic DOST-SEI RA 7687 scholarship evaluation with support for multiple cohort years (AY 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026). Evaluates your current standing against scholarship rules and surfaces warnings before you lose status.
